    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during program execution, causing the program to terminate abruptly. \n",
    "Exceptions are raised when an error occurs that is not handled by the program's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause: Syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code's syntax, such as missing colons, parentheses, or quotes. \n",
    "          Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the code is syntactically correct, but something unexpected happens at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the interpreter when it parses the code, before the program is executed. \n",
    "              Exceptions, on the other hand, are detected during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling: Syntax errors cannot be handled programmatically because the program cannot even run when they occur. \n",
    "             Exceptions, on the other hand, can be handled using try-except blocks or other methods, allowing the program to recover from the error and continue executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples: Some common examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing parentheses, or using an incorrect operator. \n",
    "             Some common examples of exceptions include attempting to divide by zero, accessing an invalid index in a list, or attempting to open a non-existent file.\n",
