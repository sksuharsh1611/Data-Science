# Data Science Assignments
This repository contains assignments and projects completed as part of a data science course.

# Course Overview
  The course covers the following topics:
  
    -	Python programming fundamentals
    
    -	Data exploration and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
    
    -	Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
    
    -	Machine learning algorithms for classification and regression
    
    -	Natural language processing and text mining
    
    -	Deep learning and neural networks

# Assignments
Each assignment is contained in its own directory and includes a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and any relevant data files. The assignments cover a range of topics and are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the course lectures.

# Projects
 In addition to assignments, this repository also contains several larger-scale projects completed as part of the course. These projects involve real-world datasets and often require the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and techniques.

# Getting Started
  To run the Jupyter Notebooks contained in this repository, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. The necessary Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you notice an error in one of the assignments or have a suggestion for improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request.
